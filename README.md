Database Management Systems  

These are the different stages of my course project of implementing an database management system called minirel.  

- stage3: implementing a buffer manager 
- stage4: implement a File Manager for Heap Files that also provides a scan mechanism that will allow you to search a heap
file for records that satisfy a search predicate called a filter.  
- stage5: implement the front-end and database utilities of Minirel.design and implement the Minirel catalog relations.
