Project Requirement:

In this part of the project, you will implement a File Manager for Heap Files that also provides a scan mechanism that will allow you to search a heap

file for records that satisfy a search predicate called a filter. How are heap files different from the files that the DB layer of Minirel provides? The main

difference is that the files at the DB layer are physical (a bunch of pages) and not logical. The HeapFile layer imposes a logical ordering on the pages

(via a linked list).
